### **v1 - 2020.07.13**

1. **Think outside the box**
   *If all your experiments succeed, you're not doing enough experiments. Step out of your comfort-zone, go crazy and explore new playable concepts.*



2. **Get a lot of feedback**
   *Playable builds ASAP! Test early, observe & listen frequently and carefully to the players. It's even better if your build has a goal and a challenge to overcome.*



3. **Wake up & play**
    *As soon as you take a huge break from your game, wake-up or something similar, let someone else play in front of you and observe as a spectator, you might notice issues you haven't before because you were so immersed in your own screen.*

  

4. **Make it easy to learn, but hard to master**
   *Have your core mechanics ready as soon as possible and use the extra time to identify their difficulty factors. This gives you more time to tweak and explore them. Remember of the [4:44 rule](https://youtu.be/lPyYZjCQ0Is).*

   

5. **Form follows function**
   *One of the ways you can make your game easy to learn is by explaining your rules through form. Use visuals & sounds to shape your rules.*

   

6. **Turn on the big picture mode**
   *It's easy to get lost and "waste" a bunch of time in tiny details, look for the changes that'll have the higher time/result value.*

   

7. **Optional challenges**
   *Players enjoy challenging themselves, try to throw some optional challenges/shortcuts alongside the game and let themselves impose the difficult they want to play. Have a multiple ways to overcome a challenge while keeping in mind the minimum and maximum difficulty for each one.*

   

8. **Give them some dopamine**
   Reward positive behaviors immediately. They did what you expected? Here, have some particles and a cool sound! But it's also important to have a reason to not fail, so assign a value to failure.

   

9. **Leave some bread crumbs along the way**
   *Backup your files and also save a few things that can be used in other projects*
