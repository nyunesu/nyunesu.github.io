# Nyunesu's Handbook



## Things to ask yourself before you start thinking about the game

- Do you have an innovative feature for this game?
- Why are you making this game?



## Things to ask yourself before you prototype

- What question do you need to answer with this prototype?
- How would you describe a remarkable 5 seconds moment in this game?
- Can you describe the scale of the elements compared to the player?
- What challenges would the player face and how can you measure its difficulty?
- What actions would the player preform to overcome those challenges?
- How big would the player be compared to the other elements?
- What experience and fantasy would fit this game?
- What controls would better fit this game?
- Can you use any asset/tool to speed up the prototyping process?



## Things to ask yourself before you work on the first playable prototype

- Did you answer your question(s) with the prototype(s) you've made?
  - Yes: Do you have any more questions that you need an answer?
  - No: Do you still need an answer to the remaining questions?
- What is the core experience you wish your player to have?
- What challenge the player has to overcome?
- What skills you wish the player to be challenged with?
- Is the player allowed to have the desired experience with the current set of mechanics?
- What are the forms that better communicate how each of your functions work?
- What is the player goal?
- What features do you have to implement?
- Does this idea meet your scope expectations?
- Do you have a clear priorities list to follow, in order to avoid minor adjustments while making this prototype?



Don't get too attached, kill your ideas if they don't fit.



## Things to ask yourself before the game production starts

- How will you manage the difficulty progression throughout the game?
- Can you use a [variety matrix](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/167214/rational_design_the_core_of_.php?page=7) to diversify gameplay and mechanics at a low cost?
- Does each challenge allows multiple solutions, such as an easier and hardest way of overcoming it?
- Are you providing optional challenges for the players so they can set their own difficulty?
- Are you thinking of the current player skills when creating your challenges?



## Things to ask yourself about your game feedback

- Do you give the player an instant reward for overcoming a challenge?
- Are you considering all player senses to communicate how your mechanic work to the player?
  - UI, VFX, Audio, Animation, Camera, Vibration
- Does your mechanics clearly sign their current state?
  - Before interaction, during interaction, on succeeded and on failed



## Things to ask someone playtesting your game

- What was your favorite moment or interaction?
- What was your least favorite moment or interaction?
- When did you feel the most clever?
- Was there anything you wanted to do that the game wouldn't let you do?
- If you had a magic want that could change any aspect of the game or your experience, what would it be?

There's often more than one solution to a problem. A player might present you a solution but you may find others.

Great ideas can come from anyone. Listen frequently and carefully.



## Things to constantly remind/ask yourself

- Are you assessing your tasks by priority and development stage?
  - Game Breaking: Fix immediately
  - Annoying: Fix before next task
  - Looks bad: Fix when you have time
  - Can be improved: Fix during polish period
- Are you considering the importance of a task before adding it to your backlog?
  - What value does it actually add to the game?
  - How difficult is the implementation of this feature?
  - Is it worth my time?
- Do you have milestones?
  - Can you schedule a time to show someone this feature?
    *Do this before the feature is ready so you have a milestone to follow*
  - Can you ask someone to look at my code, explain it back to me and give me feedback?
- Does your player knows what to do next?
  - Define player goals, even if they're trivial.
  - Try to have at least one short, mid and long term goal
  - Make sure the player knows (or has an idea of) how much they progressed and what is left to complete each goal
  - Think in terms of OCR gameplay loops
    *Objective, Challenge, Reward*
