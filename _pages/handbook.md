## Things to ask yourself before you prototype

- What question do you need to answer with this prototype?
- How would you describe a remarkable 5 seconds moment in this game?
- Can you describe the scale of the elements compared to the player?
- What challenges would the player face, and how can you measure its difficulty?
- What actions would the player perform to overcome those challenges?
- How big would the player be compared to the other elements?
- What experience and fantasy would fit this game?
- What controls suits this game better?
- Can you use any asset/tool to speed up the prototyping process?



## Things to ask yourself before you work on the first playable prototype

- Did you answer your question(s) with the prototype(s) you've made?

  - Yes: Do you have any more questions?
  - No: Do you still need answers?

- What is the core experience you wish your player to have?

- What challenge the player has to overcome?

- What kind of skills will challenge the player?

- Is the player allowed to have the desired experience with the current set of mechanics?

- What are the forms that better communicate how each of your functions works?

- What is the player's goal?

- What features do you have to implement?

- Does this idea meet your scope expectations?

- Do you have a priorities list to follow to avoid minor adjustments while making this prototype?

Don't get too attached to your ideas. Kill them if they don't fit.



## Things to ask yourself before the game production starts

- How will you manage the difficulty of progression throughout the game?
- Can you use a [variety matrix](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/167214/rational_design_the_core_of_.php?page=7) to diversify gameplay and mechanics at a low cost?
- Does each challenge allow you to solve it in different ways, from easy to hard?
- Are you providing the player any optional challenges so they can set their difficulty?
- Are you thinking of the current player skills when creating your challenges?



## Things to ask yourself about your game feedback

- Do you give the player an instant reward for overcoming a challenge?

- Are you considering all player senses to communicate how your mechanic works to the player?

  - UI, VFX, Audio, Animation, Camera, Vibration

- Does your mechanics sign their current state?

  - Before the interaction, while it is happening, on succeeded and on failure



## Things to remind/ask yourself

- Are you assessing your tasks by priority and development stage?

  - Game-Breaking: Fix immediately
  - Annoying: Fix before next task
  - Looks bad: Fix when you have time
  - Can be improved: Fix during the polish period

- Are you considering the task importance before adding it to your backlog?

  - What value does it add to the game?
  - How difficult is the implementation of this feature?
  - Is it worth my time?

- Do you have milestones?

  - Can you schedule a time to show someone this feature even if it's not ready yet?
  - Can you ask someone to look at my code, explain it back to me and give me feedback?

- Does your player know what to do next?

  - Define player goals, even if they're trivial.
  - Try to have at least one short, mid and long term goal
  - Make sure the player knows (or has an idea of) how much they progressed and what is left to complete each goal
  - Think in terms of OCR gameplay loops *Objective, Challenge, Reward*

## Playtest

- Early playtests should only test if a mechanic works or not, and figure out why

- Once you have multiple parts in place, you can playtest the game as experience

- Don't stick to the same testers, always bring new players

- Keep an eye out for emergent behavior

  ```
  Play patterns will emerge that you didn’t intend to create as a designer.
  If you discover emergent behavior that fits your core game experience, encourage players to pursue it by designing risk/rewards around them.
  
  e.g. when you are popping bubbles, perhaps popping three in a row gives you points.
  ```

**Execute**

1. Bring the prototype to a point where players can interact with it without explicit instructions from you
2. Offer the briefest introduction you possibly can, then have the test groups to play
3. Take notes when they get frustrated or they encounter problems
4. Note what activities they repeated or what goals they set for themselves
5. Only answer questions if play is completely halted

**Interview**

- What was your favorite moment or interaction?
- What was your least favorite moment or interaction?
- When did you feel the most clever?
- Was there anything you wanted to do that the game wouldn't let you do?
- If you had a magic wand that could change any aspect of the game or your experience, what would it be?

*Expect your playtesters to find problems in your game, not solutions*.

**Review**

- What patterns did you observe?
  - X was not obvious
  - Y was too hard
  - They didn't enjoy Z
- What joys and frustrations were shared among all playtesters?
- Did you observe any unexpected behavior?
- Can that behavior be added to the core experience of your game?

## Prototyping

**Toy**

- Create a core game mechanic with a focus on an enjoyable ‘juicy’ activity.
- Playtest with someone and observe their actions

**Playable**

- Overall aesthetics matters. Colors, shapes, sound effects and music.
- Define player goals, even if they're trivial.

**Evaluate**

- Can the player make meaningful decisions?
- Is the player getting the feedback they require to make good decisions?
- Are the major risk / reward systems in place?
- What is the pacing of the experience?
- Is there enough "what if..." to hang the rest of the game on?

## Ideas

Why are you making the game?

**Stimulate Ideas**

It's important to **take notes** as soon as something pops out

- Start with something familiar & Add/Remove/Combine mechanics
- Get inspired by other games, movies, anime, ...
- Combine multiple genres or mechanics
- Give yourself limitations
- Fiddle around in your engine

**Flesh it out**

- Obstacles to overcome
- Win/defeat conditions
- Core mechanics
- Core decisions
- One sentence pitch

**Evaluate Ideas**

- Play in your mind, does it excite you?
- List features and validate scope
- Is it easy to communicate?
- Evaluate "Hooks and Anchors"
- Does it have appealing fantasy (is this something a player would like to do in real life)?
- Evoke emotions
