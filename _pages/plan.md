## Ideation

- Can you think of multiple purposes for your desired mechanic?
- Desired setting? Can you think mechanics that fit this setting?
- What the controls would be?
- Can you clearly visualize the game's first playable state?



## Consolidate Vision

- Find one fitting persona and analyze mechanics that fit your game
- Create a RGD mechanic overview sheet (Input, Output, Difficulty)
- Mechanics should serve more than one purpose
- Make sure mechanics' form follows its function
- Define winning and failure states (Try to use an innate part of the gameplay)
- Define a single customization/expression element (The reason the player would share a screenshot of your game)
-  Define short, medium and long **OCR** loops
  - **O**bjectives that require you to overcome a **C**hallenge and when you overcome it gives you a **R**eward
- Before start production make sure you can clearly visualize how each activity will be performed moment to moment, minute to minute



## Planning

- Prioritize tasks with highest value-effort ratio
- Break down tasks longer than a Pomodoro session
- Set deliverable build milestones deadlines
- When adding a feature, check if the game does need it and if it will bring value to the targeted player persona



## Design

- Make sure to communicate to the player how much they progressed and what is left to complete each OCR loop (short, mid and long ones)
- Give the player optional challenges. If possible, allow them to solve it in different ways. Things such as power ups that offer a different way to play or an alternative path.



## Implementation

First Playable

- Input
- Core Mechanic
- Core Interactions
- OCR Loops



***If the game is not fun, it's ok to start over.***
