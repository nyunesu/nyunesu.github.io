By definition **Fast Food** is:

> name for food that is made and presented to costumers in short time. It is usually made with preheated or precooked ingredients, prepared in bulk and sold in packages for take-away. 



What is we replace *food* for *game* and adjust it a little bit:

> By definition **Fast Game** is a name for games that are made and presented to players in short time. They're usually made with pre-made assets & code, hosted on multiple platforms/websites and with a short playtime.



I know this is short but I had to document this somewhere other than twitter.
