I participated in the GMTK game jam and we made [CockaTune](https://nyunesu.itch.io/cockatune). Here are the main takeaways from that experience:



#### What I did right

- Had almost ten playable builds on the first day

- Managed to add every asset made to the game
  *I've had bad previous experiences where we had to throw away a bunch of stuff made for the jam. I didn't want this to happen this time.*
  
- Met and worked with an incredible team - [Franek](https://twitter.com/franrekk), [Brodux](https://twitter.com/broduxofficial), [Bruno](https://twitter.com/brunopixels) & [Jasioloza](https://nyune.su/404)

- Added a few optional challenges throughout the game instead of a completely linear experience

  

#### What I could've done better

- Had all mechanics ready earlier, after that add no more

- Go for more risky ideas, something crazy and different

- Even if it lasts a few days, keep a backup/repository in case of any random crashes

Basically I could add a bunch of useful advice from that experience to my previous post about prototyping. So now I have an **[self-advice page](https://nyune.su/self-advice)** where I'm keeping a updated list of advice that **works for me**. Feel free to use what works for you.
