Hello everyone,

In this post I basically talk about how I approach game jams in each stage, from brainstorm to development plan. I hope this can be useful somehow to you in your own endeavors.



## Theme Voting

If the game jam you're participating allows you to participate in the theme selection by voting, you usually get access to the possible game themes. 
Here I try to think of **what I want to make**, either something that I've been wanting to but never had the time, or a new feature or genre that I've never worked on before. Those are completely unrelated to the themes, but I attempt to find any possible correlation with each other. 



In that example I'm thinking that I want to make a Puzzle, Physics-based game or a FPS, and I'm using the previous LudumDare theme finalists as possible theme options.



> **Puzzle**
>
> Layers, Control the world, not the player, Nomad, Connections, Stuck in a loop, Day and night, Clockwork, Summoning
>
> **Physics-based Game**
>
> Decay, Connections, Stuck in a loop, Feeding the monster, Delay the inevitable, Contain it, You can't save them all, Summoning
>
> **FPS**
>
> Control the world, not the player, Feeding the monster, Contain it, Shipwrecked, You can't save them all, Death is not the end, The world changes when you are not looking
>



## Theme Reveal

After the theme is revealed I start to connecting the dots between the things I wanted to make and how they can fit the theme. I usually spend 1 or 2 hours brainstorming ideas (in a 48 ~72h game jam). I set up a spreadsheet to help me with all the fields that are necessary in the following steps.

### Idea List #1

I this table with around 10 ~ 20 entries. When you take note, it's important that you put emphasis on the **gameplay** instead of the setting.

If the theme is "*Night*" and you think about "*the power went down*", it's too vague. Try to think of it from a gameplay perspective:

*"you have limited sight from a top down perspective and have to dodge bullets"*

|   Idea Name   |    Genre    |                          Action                           |
| :-----------: | :---------: | :-------------------------------------------------------: |
| Unseen Bullet | Bullet Hell | Dodge bullets to survive during x time with limited sight |
|      ...      |     ...     |                            ...                            |



### Idea List #2

Here I try to narrow down the previous list to 5~10 entries.  With fewer entries I can go more in depth and evaluate how capable I am of making each one of them during the time frame, and also stablish a clearer vision for each idea.

|               Describe a memorable moment (5s)               |                       What excites me?                       |        How is it challenging? (Difficulty tuning)         |                  Features to be implemented                  |              Visual style              | Does it fit the scope? |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------: | :--------------------: |
| I dodge-roll at the last millisecond under a chain of bullets coming towards me and survive | Coding bullet patterns, Experimenting with occlusion shaders, hectic gameplay | Window of opportunity, Relative speed, Relative size, ... | Bullet pattern shooter, player controller, dodge ability, upgrade system | pixel art, top-down, enter the gungeon |          Yes           |
|                             ...                              |                             ...                              |                            ...                            |                             ...                              |                  ...                   |          ...           |



### Idea List #3

At this point I probably know the idea I'm gonna use, but sometimes it's a tough decision. In that case, I fill this for the finalist 1 ~ 3 ideas to better visualize what each first playable will be like.

| What does 30s of gameplay looks like?                        | What are the controls? | How are you going to code the game's rules?                  | What aspect ratio fits the game the best?                    | What's the win/failure condition?                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| You move through X, Y bullet patterns and then you switch a lever by walking on top of that to do A, B and C | WASD + Mouse           | I can do a class that makes X Y Z and then use the shader A to simulate the lights, and ... | 1:1 since it won't have any UI and you have equal amounts of screen from each side | Game restarts if you get hit and you win if you reach the final room alive |



And here we should be done with the brainstorm - of course new ideas tend to come while you're working, take notes and keep going.

Now that I have established a clearer vision for what my game should be. I can commit to my idea and start prototyping.



## First Playable

Things that I try to have working before I sleep on day 1 (usually 4~6 jam hours):

- Win/Defeat condition
- Controls
- Core Interactions/Mechanisms



## Core Gameplay

It depends on the game's scope, but I usually have those done by the end of day 2:

- Progression? How long?
- Systems complete
- Game Interface
- Gameplay tuning
- Art/Animations



To avoid getting stuck here I ask myself:

> is there anything about this feature which is **distracting** or **broken**?

If there is, I fix it asap and then move on.



## UX Improvement

Those are eventually implemented during the last day when most of the systems are already in place:

- Particles
- Audio
- Camera Effects
- Shaders
- Context
- Balance & Tweaking
- Victory/Defeat screen



## Extra Time?

Some of them can be made after submission, while others can't. It depends of how much time you got:

- Store page
- Saving systems
- Scene transitions
- Scenery variation
- Story cohesion
- In-game Tutorial





That's basically it, I hope this can be helpful for you guys somehow (:

See ya!
