## Theme Voting

If there's a theme voting round I think of **what I want to make**, either a new feature or a genre that I've never worked before or something that I've been willing to try and see how each of my ideas intersect with each theme.

> **Puzzle**
>
> Layers
>
> Control the world, not the player
>
> Nomad
>
> Connections
>
> Stuck in a loop
>
> Day and night
>
> Clockwork
>
> Summoning
>
> **Physics-based Game**
>
> Decay
>
> Connections
>
> Stuck in a loop
>
> Feeding the monster
>
> Delay the inevitable
>
> Contain it
>
> You can't save them all
>
> Summoning
>
> **FPS**
>
> Control the world, not the player
>
> Feeding the monster
>
> Contain it
>
> Shipwrecked
>
> You can't save them all
>
> Death is not the end
>
> The world changes when you are not looking



## Theme Reveal

Here I usually spend 1 or 2 hours brainstorming ideas (in a 48 ~72h game jam).  I usually set up a spreadsheet with all the fields that are necessary for all the following steps.

### Idea List #1

Usually 10 ~ 20 ideas. It's important that you put emphasis on the **gameplay**.

If the theme is "Night" and you think about "the power went down", it's too vague. Try thinking from the gameplay perspective: "you have limited sight from a top down perspective and have to dodge bullets".

|   Idea Name   |    Genre    |                          Action                           |
| :-----------: | :---------: | :-------------------------------------------------------: |
| Unseen Bullet | Bullet Hell | Dodge bullets to survive during x time with limited sight |
|      ...      |     ...     |                            ...                            |



### Idea List #2

I try to narrow down the ideas from list and keep my top (5~10). Here I can evaluate how capable I am of doing that in during the time frame and how clear is my vision for each idea.

|               Describe a memorable moment (5s)               |                       What excites me?                       |        How is it challenging? (Difficulty tuning)         |                  Features to be implemented                  |              Visual style              | Does it fit the scope? |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------: | :--------------------: |
| I dodge-roll at the last millisecond under a chain of bullets coming towards me and survive | Coding bullet patterns, Experimenting with occlusion shaders, hectic gameplay | Window of opportunity, Relative speed, Relative size, ... | Bullet pattern shooter, player controller, dodge ability, upgrade system | pixel art, top-down, enter the gungeon |          Yes           |
|                             ...                              |                             ...                              |                            ...                            |                             ...                              |                  ...                   |          ...           |



### Idea List #3

At this point I probably know the idea I'm gonna use, but sometimes I don't. So I fill this for the remaining 1 ~ 3 ideas in my list so I can visualize what my first playable will be like.

| What does 30s of gameplay looks like?                        | What are the controls? | How are you going to code the game's rules?                  | What aspect ratio fits the game the best?                    | What's the win/failure condition?                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| You move through X, Y bullet patterns and then you switch a lever by walking on top of that to do A, B and C | WASD + Mouse           | I can do a class that makes X Y Z and then use the shader A to simulate the lights, and ... | 1:1 since it won't have any UI and you have equal amounts of screen from each side | Game restarts if you get hit and you win if you reach the final room alive |



That's it for the ideas, right now I have a clear vision for what my game should be. I can commit to my idea and start prototyping.



## First Playable

I try to get this done before I go to sleep on day 1.

- Win/Defeat condition
- Controls
- Core Interactions/Mechanisms



## Core Gameplay

It depends on the game's scope, but it usually is done by the end of day 2.

- Progression? How long?
- Systems complete
- Game Interface
- Gameplay tuning
- Art/Animations



## UX Improvement

Those are made usually in the last day when the systems are in place.

- Particles
- Audio
- Camera Effects
- Shaders
- Context
- Balance & Tweaking
- Victory/Defeat screen



## Extra Time?

Some of them can be made after submission, while others can't.

- Store page
- Saving systems
- Scene transitions
- Scenery variation
- Story cohesion
- In-game Tutorial





That's basically it, I hope it can be helpful for you guys somehow (:

See ya!
