Hello!

Another quick thing that I thought it'd be great to share. I made a tiny script to generate a simple folder structure in Unity, so you can save a few minutes you'd spend organizing your folders.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I made a simple script to generate a folder structure in <a href="https://twitter.com/unity3d?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@unity3d</a> so I don&#39;t have to organize each new project<br><br>Feel free to use/distribute/customize, whatever you want<a href="https://t.co/tM13BJNwbS">https://t.co/tM13BJNwbS</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gamedev?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#gamedev</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/madewithunity?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#madewithunity</a> <a href="https://t.co/evrRKcF7fY">pic.twitter.com/evrRKcF7fY</a></p>&mdash; nyunesu (@nyunesu) <a href="https://twitter.com/nyunesu/status/1285733937952718850?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

As I said on the tweet, feel free to use/customize/distribute or whatever you want to.

That's it, I hope that's helpful for you somehow!

See ya! (:
