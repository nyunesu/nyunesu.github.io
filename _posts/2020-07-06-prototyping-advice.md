I shrunk as much as I could a list of useful advice I received from the developer I most idolize. Hope that's useful to you.



- Explore **new** playable concepts
- Clone *at least* one Mario mechanic

- Start a prototype with a question

- **Playable build ASAP**
- Playtest each build a **THOUSAND** times observing the players' patterns
- Everything starts with an input, it's the only way the player can communicate with the game
- Focus on **GAMEPLAY** and in your **CORE MECHANIC**

- Your toy is your main ingredient, think of what you can mix with it

- Analyze **EVERY** action parameter and experiment with them

- Have a **minimum** and **maximum** for each challenge

- Use the challenge to define the game's flow

- See your game as a **OCR loop** with another micro loop inside of it (Objective > Challenge > Reward)

- Reward **immediately** EVERY positive behavior

- Failures must have a cost

- When polishing look for the best possible design, sound, and visuals

- Make a code library
